# keras-deeplearning-r-tutorial
Script that runs code from Karlijn Willems' "keras: Deep Learning in R" tutorial (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/keras-r-deep-learning). 

Acknowledgements: ALL CREDIT to Karlijn Willems. This is literally a copy of her tutorial in a single R script that you can run on your own computer (assembled by Olivier Dujols) that some students found helpful when they were having trouble getting the online version to run.
